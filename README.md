This is a fork of [xmr-stak-cpu](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak-cpu) that removes the hardcoded donation parameters and makes them configurable for all users. A Visual Studio project was also added for easy building on Windows. The Visual Studio project currently has TLS and libmicrohttpd supprot disabled.
